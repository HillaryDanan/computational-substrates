# Contributing to Computational Substrates

**Thank you for your interest in contributing!** 🎉

This is **active research** and we welcome contributions from:
- Researchers testing predictions
- Engineers building substrate-aware systems
- Educators making content accessible
- Skeptics challenging our assumptions
- Anyone curious about computation and intelligence

---

## 🌟 Ways to Contribute

### 1. Test Predictions (Highest Priority!)

We have **7 falsifiable predictions** waiting for empirical validation.

**How to contribute:**
1. Pick a prediction from [`predictions/`](predictions/)
2. Read the `protocol.md` (detailed experimental design)
3. Run the experiment following the protocol
4. Document your findings (confirming OR disconfirming!)
5. Submit via Pull Request or Discussion

**We value negative results equally!** If a prediction fails, that's crucial scientific information.

**Get credit:** Contributors who test predictions will be acknowledged in:
- The repository (contributors.md)
- Any publications arising from this work
- Co-authorship if contribution is substantial

---

### 2. Improve Documentation

Make this work more accessible!

**Areas needing help:**
- Visual explanations (diagrams, infographics)
- Plain-language summaries of technical concepts
- Tutorials for specific audiences (undergrads, practitioners, etc.)
- FAQ expansions
- Video explanations or presentations

**Standards:**
- Accuracy > simplicity (don't sacrifice correctness for accessibility)
- Cite sources when making factual claims
- Mark speculation clearly
- Test explanations on target audience if possible

---

### 3. Extend the Framework

Apply substrate-aware analysis to new domains!

**Ideas:**
- Analyze new substrates (optical, quantum, DNA, molecular)
- Compare new data structures (trees, heaps, hash tables)
- Apply to specific applications (robotics, edge computing, etc.)
- Connect to related fields (economics, social systems, etc.)

**Requirements:**
- Follow the framework structure (substrate properties → implications)
- Cite empirical evidence where available
- Mark speculative claims clearly
- Make testable predictions when possible

---

### 4. Provide Code & Simulations

Help make predictions testable!

**Needs:**
- Simulation code for substrate comparisons
- Energy measurement tools
- Statistical analysis scripts
- Visualization tools

**Standards:**
- Documented code (README + inline comments)
- Include requirements/dependencies
- Provide example usage
- Open source license compatible with CC BY 4.0

---

### 5. Challenge & Critique

**Good science welcomes scrutiny!**

**How to critique effectively:**
- Be specific: Which claim? Which evidence?
- Be constructive: What would strengthen the argument?
- Distinguish: Theoretical disagreement vs. empirical uncertainty
- Cite: Provide references supporting alternative views

**Where to discuss:**
- [GitHub Issues](../../issues) for specific problems
- [GitHub Discussions](../../discussions) for broader questions
- Pull Requests for proposed changes

---

## 📋 Contribution Process

### Small Changes (typos, clarifications, small additions)

**Direct Pull Request:**
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix-typo-section-3`
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with clear message: `Fix typo in Section 3.2`
5. Push and create Pull Request
6. Wait for review (usually within a week)

### Large Changes (new content, major revisions)

**Start with Discussion:**
1. Open an [Issue](../../issues) or [Discussion](../../discussions) first
2. Describe what you want to add/change and why
3. Get feedback before investing significant time
4. Then follow PR process above

**Why?** Prevents wasted effort if the change doesn't align with project goals.

## ✅ Standards & Guidelines

### Scientific Rigor

**Required for all contributions:**

1. **Cite sources** for factual claims
   - Prefer peer-reviewed publications
   - Mark non-peer-reviewed sources as such
   - Link to papers when possible

2. **Mark confidence levels**
   - High confidence: Direct measurements, replicated findings
   - Medium confidence: Indirect evidence, theoretical extrapolations
   - Low confidence: Speculation requiring validation

3. **Distinguish fact from hypothesis**
   - "Studies show X [citation]" ← fact
   - "We hypothesize Y" ← hypothesis
   - "Z is possible but unproven" ← speculation

4. **Be honest about limitations**
   - What data is missing?
   - What assumptions are we making?
   - What alternative explanations exist?

5. **Reproducibility**
   - Provide enough detail that others can replicate
   - Share data, code, and protocols
   - Document software versions, parameters, methods

### Writing Style

**Balance accessibility with precision:**
- Define technical terms on first use
- Use concrete examples
- Include plain language summaries for technical sections
- Maintain scientific accuracy—don't oversimplify

**Avoid:**
- Unsupported claims
- Exaggerated language ("proves", "definitively shows")
- Jargon without explanation
- Patronizing tone

**Good examples:**
- "Evidence suggests X [citation], though Y remains uncertain"
- "We predict X based on Y; this is testable via Z"
- "Traditional view claims A; we argue B based on C"

### Code Quality

**For code contributions:**
- **Documented:** README + docstrings + inline comments
- **Tested:** Include tests or example usage
- **Modular:** Break into logical functions/modules
- **Readable:** Follow PEP 8 (Python) or language conventions
- **Dependencies:** List all requirements with versions

---

## 🔬 Experimental Contributions

### Pre-Registration (Recommended)

**For testing predictions:**

1. Before running experiments, create an [Issue](../../issues) describing:
   - Which prediction you're testing
   - Your methodology
   - Expected timeline
   - How you'll analyze results

2. This creates a public record (pre-registration)
3. Prevents "p-hacking" or selective reporting
4. Increases credibility of findings

**Not required, but strongly encouraged for scientific integrity.**

### Reporting Results

**Include:**
- Detailed methodology (enough for replication)
- Raw data (when shareable)
- Statistical analysis
- Confidence intervals or error bars
- Limitations and potential confounds

**Report EVERYTHING:**
- Confirming results ✓
- Disconfirming results ✓
- Null results ✓
- Unexpected findings ✓

**All outcomes are valuable!** Don't suppress disconfirming evidence.

## 📝 File Organization

### Adding New Content

**Follow the [structure guidelines](STRUCTURE.md):**

**New prediction?**
→ `predictions/08_new_name/protocol.md`

**New experiment?**
→ `experiments/experiment_name/README.md`

**New documentation?**
→ `docs/new_doc.md`

**New figure?**
→ `figures/conceptual/` or `figures/data/`

**See [STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md) for detailed guidelines.**

### File Naming
