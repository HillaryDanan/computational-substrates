# Testable Predictions

This directory contains detailed protocols for testing the seven falsifiable predictions derived from the computational substrates framework.

## The Seven Predictions

1. **Substrate-Task Matching** - Performance correlates with substrate-task match score
2. **Energy-Complexity Scaling** - Energy consumption scales differently by substrate/algorithm  
3. **Cognitive Ability Distribution** - Humans show bimodal performance distribution
4. **Neuromorphic Crossover** - Neuromorphic hardware outperforms conventional silicon on energy for specific tasks
5. **Hybrid Superiority** - Hybrid architectures outperform single-substrate systems
6. **Graceful Degradation** - Damage causes different failure patterns per substrate
7. **Algorithm Optimality** - Different substrates prefer different algorithms

## Status

- ✅ Prediction #2 (Energy Scaling): Detailed protocol complete
- ⏳ Predictions #1, #3-7: Protocols in progress
- 🔬 Empirical validation: Not yet started

## How to Contribute
